				<p>
					A useful but challenging task is to organize the knowledge work of a large
					community. It is useful because it helps people within that community find
					potential partners, ideas, and understanding that helps them further their own
					work. It is challenging because the shape and processes of different works can
					be very unique. This makes it especially difficult to organize all such works in
					a single place without placing limits on what a piece of work can be.
				</p>
				<p>
					It would be hard to build a system that can completely support all existing
					works in a community from the beginning. Instead, imagine a system that allows
					for new support to be added slowly over time. To begin with, all works are
					simply represented by a title or a link. Over time, groups of works that are
					similar (for example, a written article) could be supported more fully such that
					the content of the article is included along with the title or link. Repeating
					this process would eventually allow for a system that can be the home for a
					majority of work without closing the door on new types and approaches. The
					system grows to the particular works and processes of that community.

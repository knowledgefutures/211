				<h2>A Format for Conveying Ideas Simply, Without Jargon</h2>

				<p>
					I usually speak with others who are in my field of work and familiar with the
					trends and ideas common to my daily activities. It is easy to write in a manner
					that can be understood by these colleagues, but not by folks outside the field.
					Such writing is often also difficult to understand after long periods of time,
					as it assumes context related to the particular moment that it was written.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two common aspects of such writing is that it is too long (I spend a lot of
					words commenting on specific pieces of context), and it uses industry specific
					words. I would like to challenge myself to write in a way that is more to the
					point, and more available to a general audience.
				</p>
				<p>
					I hope this site and project can help us give more though to the number of words
					and type of words we use in describing our ideas.
